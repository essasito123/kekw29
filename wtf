   Hello everyone 
   @marcioziomek yeah I’m on the same book as you But I’ll try and find something to keep my mind off it
   Hello @marcioziomek 
   @marcioziomek Or listening to music, when im in London etc, just put my headphones on and listen to music to cope with it
   got a new laptop coming, the old one died
   It can get messy
   @marcioziomek Yeah i always find ways to keep my self enjoyable But sometimes at College I just stick my music on and just focus away Or just do something at Home
   @marcioziomek Best way to do it mate, just take your mind off things.
   thanks for the stream today <3
